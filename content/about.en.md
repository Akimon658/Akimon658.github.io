This site is Akimo([@akimon658](https://twitter.com/Akimon658))'s blog.
I'll write about Pokémon and tech.

## About Me

I'm a Pokémon Trainer, who loves Google and [BUMP OF CHICKEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_of_Chicken).
I'm learning English, so I'm happy if you make a comment or give me some advice.

## System requirements

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

I can't test on Safari because I don't have Apple devices.
If you find any issues, please report on [GitHub](https://github.com/Akimon658/akimon658.github.io/issues)!
